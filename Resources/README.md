Pyber Ride Sharing 

Analysis 


After graphing the data we see that there is a correlation between number of rides and the average fare per city. Urban cities have the highest number of rides, the highest number of drivers and had the lowest average fare of the three city types.

Urban cities have the highest percentage of total fares (62.7%), have the largest percentage of total rides(68.4%)and had the largest percentage of drivers(86.7%).

Even though rural cities had the highest average fare per city, the rural cities had the smallest segment of the total fares by city pie chart at 6.8%.
